# Rental System v1 
This rental system designed to be used to track and manage current rentals offered by the store.

# STEPS FOR CREATION PROCESS
# Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with Necessary Technologies
- Learn Spring Boot: Begin with basic tutorials on Spring Boot, focusing on creating simple web applications.
- Explore LightSpeed API: Review the LightSpeed API documentation to understand the endpoints you’ll need to interact with.
- Database Management: Refresh your knowledge on SQL and learn about integrating databases using Spring Data JPA.

# Step 3: Plan and Design Your Application
- Define Requirements: Clearly outline what your system needs to do. This should include user stories or use cases detailing functional requirements.
- Sketch the Architecture: Plan how different components of your application will interact. Decide on the database schema and the overall architecture (e.g., MVC).
- Design the UI: Mock up what the user interface will look like, especially for the customer-facing parts.

# Step 4: Start Small with a Prototype
- Initial Setup: Use Spring Initializr to set up a new Spring Boot project with dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and any necessary database drivers.
- Simple API Integration: Implement a basic connection to the LightSpeed API to retrieve product information or update inventory.
- Basic Functionality: Develop simple versions of your inventory and rental management features.

# Step 5: Develop the Application
- Build Out Features: Gradually add all planned features, ensuring each one is fully functional before moving on to the next.
- Implement the Frontend: Develop the frontend, whether it’s a separate application or integrated into your Spring Boot application using Thymeleaf.

# Step 6: Test and Debug
- Unit Testing: Write and run unit tests for all components using JUnit.
- Integration Testing: Ensure that all parts of your application work well together, particularly integrations with the LightSpeed API.
- Debugging: Continuously test and debug your application throughout development to catch and resolve issues early.

# Step 7: Deploy and Refine
- Deployment: Deploy your application to a production environment. Consider using a cloud service provider like AWS or Heroku.
- Feedback Loop: After deploying, gather feedback from end-users and stakeholders to identify any areas for improvement.

# Step 8: Continuous Learning and Improvement
- Iterate: Based on feedback, make necessary adjustments and improvements.
- Expand Skills: Continue learning more advanced topics in Spring, RESTful API design, and other relevant technologies to enhance your application over time.

# Step 9: Project Management and Documentation
- Keep Detailed Records: Document your development process, decisions made, and reasons for those decisions.
- Project Tracking: Use your project management tools to track progress and adjust timelines as needed.
